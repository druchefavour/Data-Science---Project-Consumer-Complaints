## Data-Science---Project-Consumer-Complaints

# Consumer Complaints in Financial Institutions 

Customers want brands to value them, respect them, and treat them like the individuals they are. Financial institutions are aware of this fact so they work hard to provide personalized cross-channel engagement to defend against new competitors and drive profit growth. It is vital for organizations to obtain feedback from their customers. This is especially important when a customer has perceived an unfavorable service experience. One way to receive feedback from these customers is to encourage and facilitate the complaint process. For many of these institutions, analyzing customer complaints data and tying the results to individuals give them additional insight into their customers that they can use for risk management, pricing, and achieving higher levels of customer satisfaction. This is the fundamental problem that the project aims to solve.

# DATA FOR THE STUDY
The main focus of this project is to analyze the mass of data on consumer's complaint obtained from the consumer financial bureau: 
Consumer Complaint Data

The organization is an independent body which receives and sends thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for their response. Complaints are listed in their database after the company responds or after they’ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first. The data are posted in text format and would require collation and cleaning.

Data on the following variables/ parameters would be collated and used for the analysis: 

Bank Name, Frequency of complaints, Category of Complaint/ Issue, Time to Respond, Closure Strategy and Response type (Public or Private?). Other information would include (Number of branches/ Market capitalization) as a measure of Bank size.

The data set was created in June 15 2015.    

# PROJECT QUESTIONS
The project will focus on predicting future customer’s behavior relative to existing data. Some questions that would be addressed in the project include:
1.How does the closure strategy adopted by the organization impact on consumer’s behavior?
2.What is the future outlook of consumer complaints in the various organizations; with respect to products and services and with respect to regions?
3.What factors would help reduce consumer’s complain and breed consumer confidence?

# DELIVERABLES
The key deliverables for this project include the following:

1.Code: Every code written for the project will be saved in github Github
2.Final Report: A final report summarizing the problem statement, approach to solving the problem, recommendations and suggestions for further work on the projects would be prepared.
3.Slides: Presentation slides will be prepared on the result of the project 
4.Presentation: Final presentation will be made during one of the office hours. A video of the process and results will also be prepared and saved in the git repository.
